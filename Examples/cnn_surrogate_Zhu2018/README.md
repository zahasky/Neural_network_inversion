PyTorch Implementation of Bayesian surrogate modeling 
for PDEs with high-dimensional stochstic input, such as permeability field, 
Young's modulus, etc.

The three columns in each image correspond to three output fields:
(1) pressure field, (2)(3) velocities field in x and y axies.
The four rows in each image from top to bottom show: (1) simulator output, 
(2) surrogate prediction (predictive mean), (3) error between simulator and prediction, 
(4) two standard devivation of prediction. 

## Dependencies
- python 3 or 2
- PyTorch 0.4
- h5py
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## Installation
- Install PyTorch and other dependencies

- Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/cics-nd/cnn-surrogate.git
cd cnn-surrogate
```


## Dataset
Download Darcy flow simulation dataset with input Gaussian random field (with 
exponential kernel) and three output fields (pressure and velocities fields).

Download KLE4225 dataset:
```bash
bash ./scripts/download_dataset.sh 4225
```
Change 4225 to 500, 50 to download KLE500, KLE50 datasets. 
Data is saved at `./dataset/`.

Number of training data within each dataset:
* KLE50: [32, 64, 128, 256],
* KLE500: [64, 128, 256, 512],
* KLE4225: [128, 256, 512, 1024].

Number of test data: 500.
Number of Monte Carlo sampling data: 10,000.

## Start with a Pre-trained Model

Download a pre-trained model:
```bash
bash ./scripts/download_checkpoints.sh 4225 256
```
where 4225 and 256 refer to the intrinsic input dimensionality of dataset and
number of training data. The pre-trained model is downloaded to the same location (`./experiments/Bayesian/*/`) as if it was trained on local machines. You may proceed to use the pre-trained model for UQ tasks.

## Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)
Perform UQ tasks, including:

- Prediction at one input realization
- Uncertainty propagation
- Distribution estimate
- Uncertainty quality assessment (realiability diagram)
```
python post_proc.py --post --kle 4225 --ntrain 256
```
Do not forget to add the `--post` switch. For KLE4225 with 128 data, `--epochs` should be set to 400 to show convergence.


## Training

### Deterministic Surrogate 

Train a non-Bayesian surroagte (e.g. with 256 data from KLE4225 dataset):
```
python train_det.py --kle 4225 --ntrain 256
```
The runs are saved at `./experiments/deterministic`.

### Bayesian Surrogate
Train a Bayesian surrogate (e.g. with 256 data from KLE4225 dataset
using SVGD with 20 samples):
```
python train_svgd.py --kle 4225 --ntrain 256 --n-samples 20
```
The runs are saved at `./experiments/Bayesian`.
It takes 1-2 hours to train a Bayesian surrogate with 256-512 training data 
(20 samples, 300 epochs, batch-size 16) on a single GPU.
